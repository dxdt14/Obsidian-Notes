[Magnetic eigenmaps for community detection in directed networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07359)
## Abstract
- eigenfunctions of the magnetic Laplacian, called magnetic eigenmaps, incorporate structural information

## Introduction
- As opposed to random walks a method utilizing a magnetic Laplacian is proposed which allows for one to use a generator which is a complex valued Hermitian operator
-

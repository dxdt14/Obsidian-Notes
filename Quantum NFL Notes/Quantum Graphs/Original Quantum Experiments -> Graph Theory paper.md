[Quantum Experiments and Graphs: Multiparty States as coherent superpositions of Perfect Matchings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06646)
follow up paper [[Quantum Experiments->Graph Theory]]
## Abstract
- photon quantum setups $\iff$ undirected graph
	- Every term in the emerging quantum superposition $\iff$ perfect matching in graph
	- Hall's marriage problem can be rephrased into quantum experiments
## General Notes
- Show both quantum experiments $\to$ graphs and graph theorems $\to$ quantum experiments
- $\#$ of terms in the resulting quantum state $\iff$ $\#$ perfect matchings in corr. graph
- doesn't seem like anything directly links to this research
- May want to look at quantum networks
- rly f'ing cool paper tho
